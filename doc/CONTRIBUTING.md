## Contributing

In general, we follow the fork-and-pull git workflow:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Commit changes to a branch in your fork
3. Pull request "upstream" with your changes
4. Merge changes in to "upstream" repository

:warning: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request.
